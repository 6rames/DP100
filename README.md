# DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure

> ## Important Notice!
>
> This repo will be replaced by a [new repo](https://aka.ms/mslearn-dp100) on **December 12th 2020**. The corresponding courseware will also be updated at this time. We're making this change to:
> - Consolidate the labs used in the [DP-100 instructor-led course](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01_) and the self-paced exercises in the equivalent online modules on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/).
> - Update labs to reflect recent changes in the Azure Machine Learning service and SDK.
> - Add new labs on topics related to responsible machine learning.
>
> On Dec 7th 2020, Azure ML SDK 1.19.0 was released. In this release, estimators are deprecated; so any labs that use estimators will fail. We'll be releasing a refreshed version of the course next week, which will address this (and other) issues. In the meantime, you can apply either of the following workarounds:
> - Pin the SDK version to 1.18.0 (so in steps to install the SDK, use pip install azureml-sdk==1.18.0. However, you might experience some compatibility issues in later labs)
> - Use the updated labs (which will be the "official" labs for the refreshed course from next week onwards) at https://aka.ms/mslearn-dp100 - they more or less follow the same flow as the existing labs, but do not use estimators.
>
> After a short interval, this repo will be archived.

This repo contains the lab files for Microsoft course [DP-100T01-A: *Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01).
